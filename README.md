## This project has beend developed for my personal use as a PhD student. I had to deliever a literature review for my paper and had to go thorugh many papers. 
This project deals with Pdf files. It gets through Streamlit a user input with an upload. Then it extract text (PyPdf) creates chunks and vectorize them (FAISS) 
then I gets user input (query) and embeddes it using OpenAI embedding to match similarities with chunks and responds to user. 
Feel free to clone the repo and use it.
